<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>UDP Data Mixer</H1>
<H2>Preface</H2>
<P>This page is a quick write-up on a data mixing project done as a class
project.  This page was written several months after the project to help
anybody that stumbles upon it.  If you need more information or clarification,
I will be glad to discuss it with you.</P>

<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>This project was written in the latter half of a 10 week course on
computer networks.  The goal of the project is to demonstrate some of the
techniques that may be used in real-time mixing of UDP data over the current IP
network.  It also sheds some light on areas that require advance consideration
before a given data mixing service is implemented.  Such areas include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>mixing method</LI>
<LI>mixing rate</LI>
<LI>packet ordering</LI>
<LI>lost packet handling</LI>
<LI>joining mixing group</LI>
<LI>leaving mixing group</LI>
<LI>mixer resource allocation</LI>
</UL>

<P>Though the work done for this project has no practical use in it's
current form, it serves as a guide for future developers to services such as:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>IP call conferencing</LI>
<LI>video whiteboarding</LI>
<LI>multi-sensor integration</LI>
<LI>IP symphony</LI>
<LI>joining mixing group</LI>
<LI>leaving mixing group</LI>
<LI>mixer resource allocation</LI>
</UL>

<P>For this project, a finite number of clients in a mixing group will send
their data to a mixing proxy.  The data sent shall be a compressed M&times;N
grid of ones (1) and zeros (0).  The role of the proxy is to mix the data from
all the clients and display the results.</P>

<H2>Design</H2>
<P>There are two main components to this project, the client and the proxy.
The client serves as a data transmitter and the proxy receives and mixes the
data.  For each group there may only one mixer and up to 35 clients.  The limit
on the number of clients is because of the mixing technique (
<A HREF="#mixing">see below</A>), it is not a network limitation.</P>

<A NAME="client"></A><H3>Client</H3>
<P>The client for the real-time data encoding and mixing project generates a
random cell grid of ones (1) and zeros (0) in a M&times;N grid (M and N need
not be the same for each client).</P>

<P>The client is initialized with the dimensions of its grid, and the address
and port of the <A HREF="#proxy">proxy</A> which handles its mixing group.<SUP>
<A HREF="#footnote1">1</A>,<A HREF="#footnote2">2</A></SUP> Then an initial
request to join the group is issued to the proxy.</P>

<P>After the client joins the group, the first grid is then randomly generated
and packed into an array of bits.  The array is transmitted to the proxy using
the UDP &quot;connection&quot; which was established at the beginning of the
session.  For verification purposes the curses library is used to display a
copy of the grid on the screen.  A side effect of this is that grid size is
limited by screen dimensions.</P>

<P>An alarm is triggered every frame to cause a random &quot;mutation&quot; of
old grid cells and the transmission of the newly mutated grid.  The frame time
is two seconds, a compile time constant which allowed me enough time to
visually verify correctness.</P>

<P>To allow for a controlled simulation of network conditions (and a natural
exit), the proxy will scan the client keyboard and respond to the following
commands:</P>

<A NAME="proxy"></A><H3>Proxy</H3>
<P>The proxy for the real-time data encoding and mixing project. It mixes grids
of random cells of ones (1) and zeros (0) transmitted by its clients.</P>

<P>When a client joins the group, a storage array for that client's latest data
is added to a collection of client data.</P>

<P>An alarm is triggered every frame which causes the proxy to mix data
according to its <A HREF="#mixing">mixing</A> algorithm.  The frame time is two
seconds, a compile time constant which allowed me enough time to visually
verify correctness.</P>

<H4>Receiving Packets</H4>
<P>When the proxy receives a client's packet, it compares the sequence number
of the new packet with the sequence number of the last packet accepted from
the client.  If the sequence number is greater than the last accepted sequence
number, the proxy will do the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the packet into floating point values</LI>
<LI>Store the data and it's sequence number</LI>
<LI>Marks the data as current for this frame</LI>
</UL>
<P>The data is stored as a floating point value so that lost packets may be
handled in a semi-graceful manner. <A HREF="#lost">(see below)</A></P>

<A NAME="mixing"></A><H4>Mixing</H4>
<P>Once every two seconds a frame is mixed. All updated data is added together
and any data not updated this frame is approximated <A HREF="#lost">(see
below)</A>.  Any non-integer cells are rounded to the nearest integer value.
Finally the results of the mixed grids are displayed on the proxy's terminal.
I know that the mixing is not so difficult, but any algorithm could be use
here.  It wasn't the point of the program.</P>

<A NAME="lost"></A><H4>Lost Packets</H4>
<P>During the mixing, if any client's data is not marked current for this
frame, it is considered to have a lost packet.  The current algorithm for handling the lost packets is to halve the value of the each cell in the previously received packet and treat the halved values as current.</P>
